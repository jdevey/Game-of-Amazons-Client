Game of Amazons is a simple board game typically played on a 10 x 10 board with the following setup:

...W..W...

W........W

B........B

...B..B...

Pieces are queens, and each side (white and black) take turns moving a single queen. Queens cannot capture, but when the land in a square, they may shoot an arrow along any diagonal or straight path. When an arrow lands, it remains there for the remainder of the game and cannot be captured. The last player to make a valid move wins.
